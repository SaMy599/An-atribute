                he is my dad his name is amresh kumar, now if ur an indian u might think about why there is still kumar why not title of caste? So the reason of not writting title with his name due to consistency of his name in his documents. Now let me tell you something about him and why i tribute to him, the story begins from the day my dad born, however i wasn't back then but i am predicting these stuffs according to present situation, so my grandfather had three son and no daughter and  my dad was the 2nd one so the time went, he grew up and grew up very strong, 6ft tall(approx he might taller than that) and handsome. 
                so when he grew up, he spent most of his time working in the fields with my grandfather and grandmother and his 2 brother does't work as much as he used to do and schooling at the local goverment school, so in india no matter how handsome you are, if you aren't white in color then u won't get any attentions no matter how handsome you are, so that happend with my dad he was handsome but he had brown skin tone that's why he wasn't getting so much attentions though, however boy around him were jealous to him cuz of his dominant height around his area(my village).

                So when he grew up he used to spend most of his time working in the fields with my grandfather and grandmother with his 2 brothers but they don't work as much as my father used to do cuz he was able to do a lot of work with his own and he tells that when he work he gets too hungry and eats a lot and i experience this too when had a chnace to work in the field i work and when i come home and having meal i feel like i never ate it before cuz when u do a lot of hard work and done the work then your food will taste like something you never tasted even if it's a dry chapati or bread or usual meals you have everyday as a man you can feel that way.

                Yeah my dad got married at young age(I don't know the exact age), At first he don't have any jobs, he was unemployed but after 2 - 3 yrs he got a job of teacher near village of my mother's village and after stuggling to go from my father's village(my village) which was far then my mama's village so they took a room on rent in a town and start to live there till then i was about 6 - 7 yrs old,At this age i started studying  in schools and my mama used to teach at home and my papa used give me questions tol solve and my mama used to help me, teach me even though don't studied that much which gives me a lot confidene and courage. My papa used to teach me as a man what is important to learn and he plays a big role to build me as a man, I am 17 right now after few day i will be 18 and i can say that every lesson my mama and papa gave was worth and going to be worth in the future and mama and my papa loves me a lot and i love them a lot too. And i have a big brother who is in college right now he is my supporter and and i am very glad to god that i got mama, papa and brother like them i love my family and i love my and i am greatful to god for giving everything i have right now.
